**languages used in the project:**

 **how much from ich :**
  
|percent | language |

|Html    | 60%      |

|Js      | 10%      |

## main challenges
 as the head of the Repo says : 
 > this project was hard as f
> but thank god we found mr.panahiyan!

if you need more info about our Project : [Click Here](google.com)

the key part is these lines of js :
```JavaScript
document.getElementById('DisplayChanger').addEventListener("click" , ()=> {
    const p = document.getElementById('mehrad');

    p.classList.toggle('hidden');
});
```
the quastion is what the hell **hidden** is , well it is a class :
```css
.hidden{
  display : none ;
}
```
## main thing 
this class completly disspeares the paragraph or any other element that we want !
